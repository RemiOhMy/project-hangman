Project Hangman from TOP - Ruby Curriculum

Goal is to create a hangman game, where the player inputs a letter to guess a random word from a list in a text file. The player gets 10 incorrect guesses before they lose the game, and the player must also be able to save their progress and resume at a later time (through serialization).
